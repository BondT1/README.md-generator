  ## Description

   This challenge was to create a professional README generator using node. The README will contain a project title, description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage instructions, a license, contributor guidelines, test instructions, and contact details. Once the user has answered the questions in the command line, a README will be created in the generated folder including the user inputs.

  The purpose of this project was to find a quick and easy way to create a detailed README file for your projects.

  Node, Inquirer, and npm are used in the project
